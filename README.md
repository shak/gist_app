Instructions:

- Ensure you have Node available.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Once all dependencies have finished installing, run `npm start`. I have set up the application to automatically transpile, minify and output to a dist directory from which it would be served on the local host. The `start` script should output the address in the command line also but find it at `http://localhost:9000/`
